## 🌐 Deployment

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Deployment Options
- **Vercel** - Recommended for Next.js (one-click deployment)
- **AWS (Amplify, EC2, ECS)**
- **Google Cloud (App Engine, Cloud Run)**
- **Self-hosted (VPS, Docker)**

---

## 📝 API Integration

**Current State:** All data is mock/hardcoded. Ready for API integration.

When connecting to a backend:
1. Define API endpoints and types
2. Use React Query hooks for data fetching
3. Implement error handling and loading states
4. Add pagination for large datasets
5. Set up environment variables for API URLs

---

## 🎯 Development Workflow

### Code Style
- **ESLint** configured for code consistency
- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled
- **Prettier** formatting (via ESLint)

### Component Development Pattern
1. Use `"use client"` directive for interactive components
2. Prefer functional components with hooks
3. Extract reusable components to `src/components/`
4. Use shadcn/ui components as building blocks
5. Style with Tailwind CSS utilities

### Adding New Pages
1. Create folder in `src/app/` with `page.tsx`
2. Wrap with `"use client"` if using hooks
3. Import layout components
4. Add to Sidebar navigation if needed
